    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Held annually since 2021, the Digital Services Awards was first introduced by the government to recognise outstanding achievements and excellence in delivering digital services to the public. Additional award categories were introduced in 2023 to honour the broader community for their valuable contributions.</p>
    <p>To ensure only the best digital services are recognised, nominees and entries undergo a rigorous assessment process spanning four months. This process consists of multiple stages involving technical scoring using widely recognised evaluation criteria and powered by the <a target="_blank" aria-label="WOGAA" href="https://wogaa.sg/">Whole-of-Government Application Analytics (WOGAA)</a> tool, expert judging panels, and qualitative feedback from citizens and users with different abilities.</p>

    <h3>NEW in 2023</h3>
		<p>This year's theme, <strong>Empathy at the Heart of Tech</strong>, underscores the significance of co-creating digital services with users and serving their needs with ease and delight.
			
In line with the theme, a new award category - "Outstanding Citizen Contributor" has been introduced to recognise citizens, while the categories of “Best Usability” and “Most Popular Informational Website” have been open to Industry nominations for the first time. We hope this will create momentum and encourage more citizens and private sector organisations to improve the usability and inclusiveness of local digital services.</p>
