    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The Digital Services Awards (DSA) celebrates excellence in delivering digital services to the public. Since its launch in 2021, DSA has been an annual event honouring outstanding achievements. Participants benefit from rigorous assessment processes, including technical scoring using widely recognised evaluation criteria powered by the <a target="_blank" aria-label="WOGAA" href="https://wogaa.sg/">Whole-of-Government Application Analytics (WOGAA)</a> tool, expert judging panels, and qualitative feedback from citizens and users with diverse abilities.  </p>
    <h3>NEW in 2024</h3>
		<p>This year’s theme “Sparking Co-creation, Igniting Innovation” celebrates the power of co-creation and user-centricity to ignite innovation and improvements across digital services in Singapore.</p>
		<p>In line with this theme, we are thrilled to announce two new award categories: Most Mobile Optimised Website (Government and Industry) and Most User-Centric Website (Government). These new categories recognise leaders in mobile optimisation and user-experience, as well as celebrate innovation and excellence in digital service delivery.</p>
