<p>The award categories have been thoughtfully crafted to provide holistic recognition by encompassing both technical and qualitative awards. </p>
<p>A significant portion of the awards is dedicated to recognising technical excellence, powered by the <a target="_blank" aria-label="WOGAA" href="https://wogaa.sg/">Whole-of-Government Application Analytics (WOGAA)</a> platform, which tracks and recommends enhancements for government websites. However, the Digital Services Awards also recognise qualitative excellence that acknowledge factors beyond technical proficiency, such as user experience and subjective visual distinctions. This balanced approach ensures that the awards acknowledge and celebrate the comprehensive achievements of digital services.</p>
