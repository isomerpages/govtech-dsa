<p>Introducing a thoughtfully curated selection of award categories, each
meticulously designed to provide holistic recognition.</p>
<p>The Digital Services Awards features three distinct segments: <a href="/government-awards/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Government</a>,
<a href="/industry-awards/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Industy</a>and <a href="/citizen-award/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Citizen</a> awards,
to celebrate a comprehensive range of digital service excellence. A significant
portion of the Government awards is dedicated to recognising technical
excellence, powered by the <a href="https://wogaa.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Whole-of-Government Application Analytics (WOGAA</a> platform,
which tracks and recommends enhancements for government websites.</p>
<p>The Digital Services Awards also recognises qualitative excellence that
acknowledge factors beyond technical proficiency, such as user experience
and subjective visual distinctions. This balanced approach ensures that
the awards acknowledge and celebrate the comprehensive achievements of
digital services.</p>
