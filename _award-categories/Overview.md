<p>Introducing a thoughtfully curated selection of award categories, each meticulously designed to provide holistic recognition.</p>
<p>The Digital Services Awards features three distinct segments: <a href="/industry-awards/">Industry</a>, <a href="/government-awards/">Government</a> and <a href="/citizen-award/">Citizen</a> awards, to celebrate a comprehensive range of digital service excellence. A significant portion of the Government awards is dedicated to recognising technical excellence, powered by the <a target="_blank" aria-label="WOGAA" href="https://wogaa.sg/">Whole-of-Government Application Analytics (WOGAA)</a> platform, which tracks and recommends enhancements for government websites. </p>
<p>The Digital Services Awards also recognises qualitative excellence that acknowledge factors beyond technical proficiency, such as user experience and subjective visual distinctions. This balanced approach ensures that the awards acknowledge and celebrate the comprehensive achievements of digital services.</p>
