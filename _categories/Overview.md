<p>The Digital Services Awards comprises thoughtfully curated award categories to provide holistic recognition of achievements in digital services.</p>
<p>The Digital Services Awards features three distinct segments: <a href="/industry-awards/">Industry</a>, <a href="/government-awards/">Government</a> and <a href="/citizen-award/">Citizen</a> awards, celebrating a wide spectrum of digital service excellence.</p>
<p>We value and recognise both technical and qualitative excellence. Technical excellence metrics are powered by the <a target="_blank" aria-label="WOGAA" href="https://wogaa.sg/">Whole-of-Government Application Analytics (WOGAA)</a> platform, which tracks and recommends enhancements for government websites. Qualitative excellence acknowledges factors beyond technical proficiency, such as user experience and subjective visual distinctions.</p>
