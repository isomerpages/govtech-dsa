<p>The Digital Services Awards comprises thoughtfully curated award categories to provide holistic recognition of achievements in digital services.</p>
<p>The Digital Services Awards features three distinct segments: <a href="/industry-awards/">Industry</a>, <a href="/government-awards/">Government</a> and <a href="/citizen-award/">Citizen</a> awards, celebrating a wide spectrum of digital service excellence.</p>
<p>We value and recognise both technical and qualitative excellence. Technical excellence metrics are powered by the <a target="_blank" aria-label="WOGAA" href="https://wogaa.sg/">Whole-of-Government Application Analytics (WOGAA)</a> platform, which tracks and recommends enhancements for government websites. Qualitative excellence acknowledges factors beyond technical proficiency, such as user experience and subjective visual distinctions.</p>

<p>In addition to the award presentations, the top 10% of Agency Champions of WOGAA (ACW) will also be recognised as Superstar Champions during the ceremony for their valuable efforts in improving government digital services.</p>

<p>ACW is an annual programme that promotes web analytics excellence and encourages knowledge sharing to enhance government digital services. Champions participate in quarterly meetups that provide them with insights, updates, and best practices to elevate their websites and digital services. </p>
